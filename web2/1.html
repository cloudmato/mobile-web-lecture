  <h1>HTML</h1>
  The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is <strong>the standard <u>markup</u> language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
  <br>
  <p style="margin-top:40px">It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
